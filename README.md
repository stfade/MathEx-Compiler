# MathEx Compiler

This is a basic compiler that translates mathematical expressions to some simple words. 
I tried to make it simple and I hope it helps you to understand the basics of compilation...
_Just run `go run main.go` to see the results._

## Lexer
Please look at the lexer package to understand lexer logic and lexical analysis.

## Parser
It categorizes the current expression and define the relations between expressions.
Please research the syntactic analysis...

## Translator
It just translates the expressions to some simple words.
